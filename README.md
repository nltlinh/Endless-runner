# ENDLESS RUNNER 

## Simple Endless Runner Game Using Unity (C#)

### Scope

- 2D platform computer game
- Game environment: The platform (grass, obstacle, and coin) would be generated randomly and endlessly.
- Movement and interaction: the player could be controlled by input (space) or by mouse
- Collision: the character can collide with items along the way (obstacles, enemies, coins, lava)
- Health and score of the character: The score and health will be displayed on the screen. The "heath" of character will reduce if it collides with obstacles or lava. The "score" will increase if it collides with coins.
- User interface: "Game over" scene, game menu scene, credits, instruction.
> Outcome: Until now, we have completed all of the scope outlined above. There is no storyline for the player, it would be purely gameplay based. The user controls the character by pressing "space" key to overcome obstacles and collect items along the way. The character will lose if it collides obstacles or falls into the lava. The game does not provide multi-players and also not divide into levels but the difficulty will increase along the way.
